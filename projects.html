    <p>This is the first program I ever wrote. Originally, it was in Python. I revamped it with JavaScript. The title works better that way.</p>

	<a href="http://www.slckravmaga.com/" title="Krav Maga Contact Combat, Salt Lake City: Website"><h1>KM|CC Website</h1></a>
	<p>I built this site after I took my introductory computer science and algorithms classes, using just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
	Everything was made from scratch, using a design the business owner dreamed up--down to the alignment of the paragraphs relative to the logo. 
	Everything had to look perfect.</p>
	<p>I learned precisely how to make every element of the page behave. And I also learned a painful lesson: avoid in-line styles from 
	square one, even during the draft phase. As long as it does its job, you won't go back and fix it later until it's biting you in 
	the backside.</p>
	<p>I also learned, later on, that classmates and coworkers will down-talk user interface design 
	ruthlessly; but, a well-done interface will <em>really</em> impress the 
	person who matters most: your boss.</p>
