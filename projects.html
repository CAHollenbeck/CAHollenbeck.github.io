    <p>This is the first program I ever wrote. Originally, it was in Python. I revamped it with JavaScript. The title works better that way.</p>

	<a href="http://www.slckravmaga.com/" title="Krav Maga Contact Combat, Salt Lake City: Website"><h1>KM|CC Website</h1></a>
	<p>I built this site after I took my introductory computer science and algorithms classes, using just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
	Everything was made from scratch, using a design the business owner dreamed up--down to the alignment of the paragraphs relative to the logo. 
	Everything had to look perfect.</p>
	<p>I learned precisely how to make every element of the page behave. And I also learned a painful lesson: avoid in-line styles from 
	square one, even during the draft phase. As long as it does its job, you won't go back and fix it later until it's biting you in 
	the backside.</p>
	<p>I also learned, later on, that classmates and coworkers will down-talk user interface design 
	ruthlessly; but, a well-done interface will <em>really</em> impress the 
	person who matters most: your boss.</p>

	<h1>My Server the Personal Trainer</h1>
    <p>This weekend (4/19/2015), I turned a surplussed PC from my old job into a server. I installed Debian and SSMTP on it, then
    made a Cron job that would email my krav maga instructor at a recurring time to make sure her emails were forwarding to her phone.</p>
    <p>Then, I figured out how to text my fianc&eacute;.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <pre>echo "STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND DO 20 PUSH-UPS." | 
   mail -s "From The Server" '##########@vtext.com'</pre>
       </blockquote>
       <p>(The 'vtext.com' part is an SMS gateway address for Verizon customers.)</p>
    <p>Now, I need to figure out how to have that text sent at two semi-random daytime hours, every day...</p>

  <p>I made this in a hotel room in about 30 minutes. Will I ever make it technologically impressive? No! But it was fun to play!</p>
