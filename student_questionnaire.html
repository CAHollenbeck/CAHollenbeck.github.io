      <H2 class="sec">Questions to ask a potential advisor’s current students</H2>
      <p class="smalltitle">Contributions from Celeste Hollenbeck, Kyle Headley, Ellen Arteca, Daniel Patterson, and others who wished to remain anonymous. Thank you.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>Many PhD applicants don't know what to look for in an advisor.</p>
      <p>The following is a list of suggested questions which you may ask current students of a potential new advisor, to gather information about the professor whom you're considering working with. It is best to ask these kinds of questions <b>after</b> you have secured an official offer to start a PhD at the university.</p>
      <p>Don't expect to get through all of these questions. The best approach is to identify the ones most important to you, ordered by priority. We tried to order them by importance as well, based on our experiences.</p>


      <br/>
      <H3>Ask many questions.</H3>
      <p>As a PhD student, your choice of advisor will have an immense impact on your career. Choosing an advisor who will champion your career and equip you with the skillset you need is one of the most important decisions you will ever make in academia.</p>
      <p>It is unlikely your prospective advisors will directly tell you about their shortcomings or attributes which will cause them to work poorly with you. There are some abusive advisors out there; however, most people are well meaning, and many issues with the student/advisor relationship are caused by incompatibilities rather than flaws in either party.</p>
      <p>Ideally, these questions should be asked live&mdash;at a PhD Open House, over the phone, or over Skype. Students may be reluctant to say anything negative for fear of their answers being traced back to them, and they will be even more reluctant to be negative in written answers.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that students may not state problems directly. Additionally, each student may have a different idea of what a good student/advisor relationship should look like. Be prepared to read between the lines.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><b>First, ask if the student would be willing to talk about their advisor. Let them know they may choose to not answer any question.</b></p>
      <p><b>If any questions yield a concerning answer: follow up. Ask why.</b></p>
      <br/>

      <H3>Mentorship</H3>
      <p>How much one-on-one time do you get from your advisor? Do you feel like it is enough?</p>
      <p>Do you feel comfortable asking your advisor questions?</p>
      <p>How would your advisor react if you disagreed or refused to do something?</p>
      <p>Do you believe your advisor assesses your performance fairly?</p>
      <p>Do you feel your advisor has kept you on track for your PhD?</p>
      <p>Do you feel like your advisor has your best interests at heart?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor endorse you in front of other colleagues in the field?</p>
      <p>Do you feel like the advice you receive is helpful? Do you have dissatisfaction about how it is delivered?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor communicate clearly and state expectations?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor encourage you to present at internal seminars, submit to workshops, attend summer schools, apply for internships, etc?</p>
      <p>Do you feel like your advisor is someone you can talk to about personal concerns (regarding work or life), and is that important to you?</p>
      <p>If you get stuck on something and don’t tell anyone about it, how long would it take before your advisor noticed?</p>
      <p>What sort of things do you get feedback and advice on? E.g. writing, presenting, career advice, how to be a researcher, technical aspects such as coding, etc. Is the feedback usually high level and general, or specific and detailed?</p>
      <p>Do you feel safe expressing dissatisfaction with your own work or project to your advisor?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor care about and support you in figuring out your future after the PhD? Is this something you are comfortable discussing with them?</p>
      <p>Do you have group meetings with your advisor? Are you happy with them?</p>


      <H3>Projects and Funding</H3>
      <p>Have you been consistently funded?</p>
      <p>Were you able to work on projects you wanted to work on, after you started?</p>
      <p>Have you ever had problems with other faculty (TA assignments, classes, collaborations, etc.); and if so, how did your advisor handle it?</p>
      <p>How did you get your current project? Did your advisor give it to you, did you choose from a selection, or did you find it on your own?</p>
      <p>Are you happy with your project?</p>
      <p>Do you feel you have ownership of your project?</p>
      <p>How involved has your advisor been with your teaching assistantships, if applicable?</p>

      <H3>Track Record</H3>
      <p>How many students does your advisor have? (Too many or too few may indicate a problem. Find out why and what the professor is doing about it.)</p>
      <p>Has your advisor lost or dismissed any PhD students? If so:
         <ul>
           <li>Why?</li>
           <li>Was there a pattern of behavior that contributed to this?</li>
         </ul></p>
      <p>Has your advisor recently graduated students; and if so, where are they now (if applicable)?</p>


      <H3>Interpersonal and Collaborative</H3>
      <p>How does your advisor respond to critical reviews of their papers?</p>
      <p>Do multiple students work on papers, or does everyone have their own separate projects?</p>
      <p>Do you feel your advisor is transparent with you about their actions and decisions? For example, do they give you notice before going out of town, share information about funding situations, etc.?</p>
      <p>Is your advisor a good classroom teacher?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor respect colleagues (fellow professors, postdocs, etc.)?</p>
      <p>Does your advisor respect students whom they don't advise?</p>

      <H3>Other</H3>
      <p>Are there any other things you would like me to know about your advisor, research group, or department?</p>
      <p>Is there anyone else whom you think I should talk to about this professor?</p>


      <br/>
      <br/>

      <H3>Final Thoughts</H3>
      <p>Good advisors and departments will not look unfavorably on a prospective student who asks a lot of questions. It’s an indication that you have options and you care about where you are going.</p>
      <p>It is not expected that good advisors will produce the right answers for all of these questions. (Several of these questions don't have "right" answers.) However, collecting this information will hopefully let potential students weigh their options and make a more informed decision.</p>
      <p>Alarming answers should be taken very seriously. Unnecessary hardship and/or dissolution of the student/advisor relationship is not an uncommon occurrence. When it does happen, it can be devastating for the student. Look out for yourself.</p>
