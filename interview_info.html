      <H2>What's Going On?</H2>
      

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I’m a PhD student in computer science at the University of Edinburgh. I mostly work on optimizing compilers; however, my research is not related to this project!</p>

<p>My collaborator (another PhD student) and I are building a new tool to make friends and romantic connections. Although we started this as just a fun side project, we got the attention of some people at our university who might like to give us a grant. For that, we need more data to inform our design and demonstrate its use.</p>

<p>Would you like to help inform us?</p>

<p>I’m conducting informal interviews to hear about people’s experiences and struggles making friends and dating people in adulthood.</p>

<p>If you participate, I’ll give you a free account for the thing we build&#8212;and the fanciest version of it!&#8212;if you decide you want it when it’s done.</p>

<p>You can also voice your frustrations about your friendship and dating experiences. I want to hear them.</p>

<H2>Are you still interviewing?</H2>
<p>Yes! If this page is still up and you are reading it, then I am still interviewing&#8212;and I want to talk to YOU.</p>

<H2>What will be asked?</H2>

<p>I will ask you questions about your thoughts and experiences regarding making friends and dating. The questions are not fixed yet. I want to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p>I will try not to ask anything uncomfortable, but you can pass on any question. There is no need to answer anything you don’t want to.</p>


<H2>How long will it take?</H2>
<p>It should take 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>However, if you have strong opinions or experiences you want to talk about, I will listen longer. I am not a mental health professional, and I can’t help you as such; but your thoughts are relevant&#8212;and if you have things you want to say, then I want to hear them.</p>

<H2>Will it be recorded?</H2>
<p>I will not record you. I will probably write down some responses to remember them later.</p>

<H2>Where will the information go?</H2>
<p>Interview answers will be put into a report for a confidential grant application. I will not publish them anywhere public. Any identifying information will be anonymized so that nobody will be able to tell who you are.</p>

<p>I might write an article talking about the trends I've seen in responses, because the common experiences I'm hearing about are <em>very interesting</em>.</p>

<H2>Who will do the interview?</H2>
<p>Me: Celeste.</p>
<p>If you prefer to talk to a man though, for any reason, I can send you to my collaborator.</p>

<H2>Whom do you want to talk to?</H2>
<p>I want to talk to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People who are currently dating.</li>
  <li>People who are not dating but <em>want</em> to be dating.</li>
  <li>People who want to make friends.</li>
  <li>People who have dated or tried to make friends within the last three or so years (approximately), don't necessarily want to make new connections, but want to help us out anyway and talk about their experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to hear from <em>all types of people</em> (over 18 years old), but I would especially like to hear from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Women</li>
  <li>LGBTQ+ people of all types</li>
  <li>Neurodivergent people</li>
  <li>Minorities (in almost any context&#8212;in your field of study, city, country, whatever)</li>
  <li>People over 40</li>
</ul>
<H2>How to contact?</H2>
<p>You can DM me on twitter: @cahollenbeck.</p>
<p>You can also email me: c.hollenbeck[at]sms.ed.ac.uk.</p>
<H2>About the Project</H2>
<p>I can't say much about the project because we're still working on it (hence why we want to hear from you). What I can say is that it has been inspired from my own struggles. When I started my PhD, I moved to a new part of the world and had to start over again making social connections. Making friends&#8212;and especially trying to date&#8212;were very difficult because of the pandemic. I think I found a way to make it easier all around.</p>

<p>I can also say that what we're doing is very different from anything else that's out there right now; and because my collaborator and I are doing this mostly for fun, we feel like we are more interested in solving the problem of loneliness rather than exploiting it for the most money possible.</p>

<p>Cheers! :)</p>
