      <H2 id="about">Some FAQs About the Interview</H2>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I’m a PhD student in computer science at the University of Edinburgh. My research is not related to this project, though.</p>

<p>My colleague (another PhD student) and I are building a new tool to make friends and romantic connections. It’s our side project, and something that we personally care about. We’re building something we would definitely use, but we want to make sure it meets the needs of other people, too. It isn’t done yet, so we aren’t going to try to sell you anything.</p>

<p>Would you like to help inform us?</p>

<p>I’m conducting informal interviews to hear about people’s experiences and struggles making friends and dating people in adulthood.</p>

<p>If you participate, I’ll give you a free account for the thing we build&#8212;and the fanciest version of it!&#8212;if you decide you want it when it’s done.</p>


	<H2>What will be asked?</H2>


<p>I will ask you questions about your thoughts and experiences regarding making friends and dating. The questions are not fixed yet. I want to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p>I will try not to ask anything uncomfortable, but you can pass on any question. There is no need to answer anything you don’t want to.</p>


<H2>How long will it take?</H2>
<p>It should take 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>However, if you have strong opinions or experiences you want to talk about, I will listen longer. I am not a mental health professional, and I can’t help you as such; but your thoughts are relevant&#8212;and if you have things you want to say, then I want to hear them.</p>

<H2>Will it be recorded?</H2>
<p>I will not record you. I will probably write down some responses to remember them later.</p>

<H2>Where will the information go?</H2>
<p>Interview answers will be put into a report for a confidential grant application. I will not publish them anywhere public. Any identifying information will be anonymized so that nobody will be able to tell who you are.</p>

<H2>Who will do the interview?</H2>
<p>Me: Celeste.</p>

<H2>About the Project</H2>
<p>I can't say much about the project yet because we're still working on it (hence why we want to hear from you). What I can say is that it has been inspired from my own struggles. When I started my PhD, I moved to a new part of the world and had to start over again making social connections. I think I found a new way to do that.</p>
<p></p>
