      <p class="smalltitle">Last updated 10/21/2019</p>
      <p>Before I began studying computer science, I was a technical writer for several years. I came to this field
as a full-fledged working adult. My pursuit of a PhD took me through three separate advisors at three different 
universities. Through my own experience and that of the students around me, I have noticed how sizable and prevalent
the knowledge gap is between students and <span class="nb">faculty&mdash;</span>in terms of both research-related knowledge and sheer years 
of life experience. Sometimes it is assumed that this information is well known when it is not. Sometimes this information is shared with a small group of favored individuals, as tribal knowledge.</p>
      <p>Sometimes this disparity of knowledge can be extremely disadvantageous for students.</p>
      <p>As a professional writer and an older PhD student at the time of this writing, I see it as my obligation to do what I can to help. These writings are intended for potential PhD students in computer science, which is a field currently rich with funding and opportunity; however, I hope some of this may be useful to students in other academic fields as well.</p>
      <p>Self-defensiveness for a PhD is not about villainizing anyone. It is about acquiring the ability to think independently, to recognize asymmetries of information, to self educate, and to enable yourself to avoid common situations that may endanger your pursuit of a PhD.</p>
      <p>This blog is a work in progress, like its author. I will update posts as necessary to improve them.</p>
